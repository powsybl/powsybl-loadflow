PowSyBl (**Pow**er **Sy**stem **Bl**ocks) is an open source framework written in Java, that makes it easy to write complex
software for power systemsâ€™ simulations and analysis. Its modular approach allows developers to extend or customize its
features.

PowSyBl is part of the LF Energy Foundation, a project of The Linux Foundation that supports open source innovation projects
within the energy and electricity sectors.

## PowSyBl vs PowSyBl Open Load Flow

PowSyBl Open Load Flow is an open source implementation of the load flow API that can be found in PowSyBl Core. It supports 
AC Newtow-Raphson and linear DC calculation methods:
 - Fast and robust convergence, based on [KLU](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html) numerical solver.
 - Distributed slack (on generation or load).
 - Generator active and reactive power limits (reactive capability curve).
 - Generator and static var compensator voltage remote control.
 - 3 starting point modes: flat, warm and DC based.

Almost all of the code is written in Java. It only relies on native code for the [KLU](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html)
sparse linear solver. Linux, Windows and MacOS are supported.

## Getting started

Running a load flow with PowSyBl Open Load Flow is easy. First let's start loading a IEEE 14 bus network. We first add a few Maven 
dependencies to respectively have access to network model, IEEE test networks, PowSyBl platform configuration and simple logging 
capabilities:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.powsybl</groupId>
    <artifactId>powsybl-iidm-impl</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.powsybl</groupId>
    <artifactId>powsybl-ieee-cdf-converter</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.powsybl</groupId>
    <artifactId>powsybl-config-classic</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.30</version>
</dependency>
```

We are now able to load the IEEE 14 bus:
 ```java
Network network = IeeeCdfNetworkFactory.create14();
 ```

After adding a last Maven dependency on Open Load Flow implementation:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.powsybl</groupId>
    <artifactId>powsybl-open-loadflow</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

We can run the load flow with default parameters on the network:
```java
LoadFlow.run(network);
```

State variables and power flows computed by the load flow are have been updated inside the network model and we can for instance 
print on standard output buses voltage magnitude and angle:

```java
network.getBusView().getBusStream().forEach(b -> System.out.println(b.getId() + " " + b.getV() + " " + b.getAngle()));
```
## Contributing to PowSyBl Open Load Flow

PowSyBl Open Load Flow could support more features. The following list is not exhaustive and is an invitation to collaborate:
- A distributed slack that can be configured by country;
- Computation on all connected components;
- Operational limits management;
- Improve the voltage regulation: only generators and static var compensators are regulating at that stage. Shunts and ratio tap changers can regulate too (local and remote). We want to model these regulations in outer loops.
