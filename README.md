PowSyBl (**Pow**er **Sy**stem **Bl**ocks) is an open source framework written in Java, that makes it easy to write complex
software for power systemsâ€™ simulations and analysis. Its modular approach allows developers to extend or customize its
features.

PowSyBl is part of the LF Energy Foundation, a project of The Linux Foundation that supports open source innovation projects
within the energy and electricity sectors.

## PowSyBl vs PowSyBl Open Load Flow

PowSyBl Open Load Flow is an open source implementation of the load flow API that can be found in PowSyBl Core. It supports 
AC Newton-Raphson and linear DC calculation methods:
 - Fast and robust convergence, based on [KLU](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html) numerical solver; it supports both dense and sparse matrices;
 - Distributed slack (on generation or on load); it also supports non distributed slack; in both cases, the slack bus selector is configurable as explained [here](https://www.powsybl.org/pages/documentation/simulation/powerflow/openlf.html#parameters);
 - Generator active and reactive power limits (support of reactive capability curves);
 - Generator and static var compensator voltage remote control through PQV bus modelling; 
 - Shared voltage control involving generators and static var compensators;
 - 3 starting point modes: flat, warm and DC based;
 - Local and remote phase control: phase tap changers can regulate active power flows; 
 - Non impedant branches support; we do not support loops of non impedant branches: in that case, a short number of non impedant lines will be treated with a minimal impedance;
 - HVDC and multiple synchronous component calculation.
 
Powsybl Open Load Flow has also an implementation of the security analysis API that can be found in Powsybl Core. It supports:
 - Network in node/breaker topology; bus/breaker topology is not supported for the moment;
 - Contingency on branches only;
 - Permanent current limits violations detection on branches;
 - High and low voltage violations detection on buses;
 - Complex cases where the contingency leads to another synchronous component where a new resolution has to be performed are not supported at that stage.

Almost all of the code is written in Java. It only relies on native code for the [KLU](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html)
sparse linear solver. Linux, Windows and MacOS are supported.

## Native builds

A native build (no need to Java runtime) can be download here:
- [Linux](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-open-loadflow/releases/download/v0.6.0/olf-linux-0.6.0.zip)
- [MacOS](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-open-loadflow/releases/download/v0.6.0/olf-darwin-0.6.0.zip)
- [Windows](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-open-loadflow/releases/download/v0.6.0/olf-windows-0.6.0.zip)

To run Open Load Flow on file ieee14cdf.txt :
```bash
$ olf loadflow --case-file ieee14cdf.txt
Loading network 'ieee14cdf.txt'
loadflow results:
+--------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Result | Metrics                                              |
+--------+------------------------------------------------------+
| true   | {network_0_iterations=3, network_0_status=CONVERGED} |
+--------+------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Getting started

Running a load flow with PowSyBl Open Load Flow is easy. First let's start loading a IEEE 14 bus network. We first add a few Maven 
dependencies to respectively have access to network model, IEEE test networks, PowSyBl platform configuration and simple logging 
capabilities:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.powsybl</groupId>
    <artifactId>powsybl-iidm-impl</artifactId>
    <version>3.8.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.powsybl</groupId>
    <artifactId>powsybl-ieee-cdf-converter</artifactId>
    <version>3.8.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.powsybl</groupId>
    <artifactId>powsybl-config-classic</artifactId>
    <version>3.8.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.22</version>
</dependency>
```

We are now able to load the IEEE 14 bus:
 ```java
Network network = IeeeCdfNetworkFactory.create14();
 ```

After adding a last Maven dependency on Open Load Flow implementation:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.powsybl</groupId>
    <artifactId>powsybl-open-loadflow</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.0</version>
</dependency>
```

We can run the load flow with default parameters on the network:
```java
LoadFlow.run(network);
```

State variables and power flows computed by the load flow are have been updated inside the network model and we can for instance 
print on standard output buses voltage magnitude and angle:

```java
network.getBusView().getBusStream().forEach(b -> System.out.println(b.getId() + " " + b.getV() + " " + b.getAngle()));
```
## Contributing to PowSyBl Open Load Flow

PowSyBl Open Load Flow could support more features. The following list is not exhaustive and is an invitation to collaborate:

We are thinking about increasing features of the loadflow engine:
- A distributed slack that can be configured by country;
- Operational limits management;
- Improve the voltage regulation: only generators and static var compensators are regulating at that stage. Switched shunts and ratio tap changers can regulate too (local and remote). We plan to model these regulations in outer loops but any suggestion is welcome;
- Allow generators to regulate reactive power, locally or remotely;
- Support the extension ```VoltagePerReactivePowerControl``` of static var compensators as another alternative of voltage regulation (remotely and locally);
- Phase control: support of current limiter mode.  

We are also thinking about services using the loadflow engine:
- PowSyBl offers the possibility to run a slow security analysis through its [load flow based implementation](https://www.powsybl.org/pages/documentation/simulation/securityanalysis/security-analysis-impl.html#load-flow-based-implementation); Open Load Flow offers now its own implementation of security analysis API called ```OpenSecurityAnalysis```: this version is minimal and could be improved, functionally and in terms of performances; please look at the issues if you want to help us.

- The possibility to perform sensitivity analysis: we are working on a prototype to compute what we call Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF); do not hesitate to contact us for more details.
