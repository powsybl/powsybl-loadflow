    + Create network 0
    + Post loading process on network 0
       Network 0 has 4 buses (voltage remote control: 0 controllers, 0 controlled) and 4 branches
       Network 0 balance: active generation=607.0 Mw, active load=600.0 Mw, reactive generation=0.0 MVar, reactive load=200.0 MVar
    + Outer loop Distributed slack on generation
       Iteration 0: slack bus active power (-1.4404045651219555 MW) distributed in 1 iterations
       Iteration 1: already balanced
