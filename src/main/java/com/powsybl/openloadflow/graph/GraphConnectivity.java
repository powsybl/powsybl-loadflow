 * Interface for incremental and decremental connectivity computations, through a mechanism which records the

 * To start recording topological changes, call {@link #startTemporaryChanges}.
 * A call to {@link #undoTemporaryChanges} will then undo in reverse order all the graph modifications which occurred since last
 * call to {@link #startTemporaryChanges}.
 * This allows several levels of temporary changes - even if some implementations might not support it.
